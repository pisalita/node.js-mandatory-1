    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <br />
    <p>There are 3 main ways to declare a variable in javascript.</p>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>var</li>
      <li>let</li>
      <li>const</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      They each differ in functionality, and var is the oldest one of the three.
      Var is either function or globally scoped, which means you sometimes have
      access to this variable outside of its scope. This can lead to confusion
      or errors, and you should no longer use var anymore ever. Let is a newer
      version of var which is block scoped, and therefore eliminated many of the
      errors that can occur. Const is essentially the same as let, but you can't
      change the initial value of it. Except if it is an object, then you can
      alter the props within it.

    <h2>Type Coercion</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Type coercion is essentially javascript, trying to alter or convert a
      datatype from one thing to another behind the scenes. We as developers do
      not want that, as it can lead to some unexpected outcomes. One way to not
      have javascript do this is using === instead of == when doing conditional
      programming. Doing this will force javascript to also validate the data
      types aswell.

    <h2>Hoisting</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Hoisting is a complex javascript principle, which essentially means, that
      in practise some code will get pushed to the top of your codebase. This
      knowledge is useful when using and talking about functions, which i cover
      in the next section.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      You can create functions in javascript and call them at a later point,
      just like most programming languages. There are multiple ways to create
      functions in javascript. function declarations (hoisted), function
      expressions (not hoisted) and arrow functions. Functions can take in
      parameters that can be used inside the function scope. This can be all the
      datatypes we covered earlier and even other functions creating a callback
      function.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Since function expressions is NOT hoisted, it enforces a more clean coding
      standard, where you always declare your function before calling it. And
      therefore can limit the amount of errors in a larger program.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Arrow functions are a more modern way of doing functions, and is the go to
      option these days. They offer a cleaner and shorter way to write
      functions.
    </p>

    <h2>Array methods</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Arrays are used alot in every programming language, and javascript is no
      different. Arrays comes with some very useful methods and here i will
      cover a few of them. Using these methods will make your code drasticly
      cleaner and more optimized. In this section i will cover the filter, map,
      forEach and find method.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The filter method creates and return a new array based on the old array,
      filtering the items based on if the condition you specify is true or
      false. So it essentially creates a new array for you, which is then
      returned with new values based on the old array and your condition. This
      method will not change the underlined array/object you are filtering!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The map method allows you to take 1 array, and convert it into a new
      array, so all the items is going to look different. In this method, you
      just specify what parts of the old array you want to copy into the new
      array, and you can even alter the values aswell. This method will not
      change the underlined array/object you are filtering!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The forEach method loops through an array, but does not actually return
      anything. This method can change the array you are looping through. This
      reduces the code needed to just loop through an array, where the syntax in
      other traditional programming languages are lengthy and more clunky.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The find method allows you to find a specific object in an array, and
      return it. This is based on true false, and return the first item that is
      true.
    </p>

  { name: "Phone", price: 500 },
  { name: "Computer", price: 1000 },
  { name: "Keyboard", price: 25 },
];

-------------------------------------------------------
<p class="code-comment">
// The filter method

<p class="code-comment">

  return item.price <= 100;

console.log(items);

    <h2>Spread operator</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      The spread operator is very useful, as it provide a very clean and short
      way of doing what some of these array methods are doing. If you for
      example need to copy one array into another array, you can easily use the
      spread operator to do this very quickly, with very little code required.
      When using the spread operator, you basicly rip out the guts of an array
      or object, and can then assign those values into a new array or new
      object. You can even add more data along with the other data you are
      getting from the spread operator.
