    <h2>Express</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Express is a very useful library when creating rest api's in node.js. It
      reduces alot of the boilerplate code, and makes the process of making a
      server and it's endpoints simple and easy. It is also very fast, and are
      very commonly used in the industry aswell. To install express you can type
      npm install express in the CLI.

    <h2>Making the express server</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      The first step in creating a rest api with node.js and express, is to make
      and instantiate a server. You should create a file called app.js, which
      will function as your server.

    <h2>Adding functionality - endpoints!</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Right now the server is not doing anything, it is just running. We need to
      make our endpoints for us to be able to send and receive data to and from
      our rest api. In this example, we will mimic a database by saving it in a
      local array. We will use the req to get data sent to us, and the res will
      be used to deliver something back to the client. This code snippet will
      give you a basic rest api template containing get, post, put, patch,
      delete.

    <h2>Rest-api theory</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      The rest-api should have a specific order, as it helps getting a quick
      overview. The most common order is the following: get, post, put, patch,
      delete.
    </p>
    <p>
      the get method fetches all the resources. the post method creates a
      specific new resource. the put method updates a specific resource. the
      patch method partially updates a specific resource. the delete method
      deletes a specific resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      When naming your endpoints, you have to think about what the table in the
      database is called, as these should directly map to that table. This means
      that in our example we always write movies, and not movie, as movie does
      not map to anything in our database. In our case our array that mimics a
      database.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can have multiple of the same endpoints, as long as the HTTP method
      differ. This is why both our get and post method have the same endpoint,
      aswell as our put, path and delete share the same endpoint!
